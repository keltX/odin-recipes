    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. 
        Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! 
        This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</p>
    <p>Prepare this easy homemade lasagne ahead of time and save in the freezer, uncooked, for when you need it during a busy week. 
        Then just bake for an extra 45 mins.</p>

        <li>125g ball mozarella, torn into thin strips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Making the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp of olive oil
            in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in
            two batches for about 10 mins until browned
            all over.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g
            pack, then stir through the meat mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour over 800g of uncooked tomato puree and 200ml
            hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg and season
        </li>
        <li>Bring up the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until
            the sauce looks rich
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat oven to 180C and lightly oil an ovenproof
            dish
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish,
            then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets 
            from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g
            ready-mate or homemade white sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat until you have 3 layers of pasta. Cover
            with the remaining 390g white sauce, making
            sure you can't see any pasta poking through
        </li>
        <li>
            Scatter 125g torn mozzarela over the top
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top.
            Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling
            and lightly browned
        </li>
        <li>Ready to serve</li>
    </ol>
